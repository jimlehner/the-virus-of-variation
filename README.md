# The Virus of Variation: Making Sense of Death and Data using Process Behavior Charts
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **The Virus of Variation: Making Sense of Death and Data using Process Behavior Charts**. 

Making sense of data, understanding variation, and improving processes is not a spectator sport. It is a method and technique that is best learned by doing. It is for this reason that the Python code, Excel files, and datasets used to generate the figures in the book are provided here.

<img src="images/The-Virus-of-Variation_Book-Cover_Final_Mockup.jpg" alt="Cover Image" width="50%">

The Python code and Excel files are organized by chapter title with the naming convetion for the files reflecting the naming convetion in the book.

The datasets used in the book are listed in the [Datasets](#datasets) section of this document. Under each dataset is a bulleted list of the chapters where the respective dataset is used. For instance, the `causes-of-death-in-1864-dublin.csv` dataset is used in Chapter 4 and Appendix B. As a result, the bulleted list that follows shows Chapter 4 and Appendix B.

## Additional Information
- **Parts of a Process Behavior Chart**: Invented by Dr. Walter Shewhart in the mid-1920s at Bell Laboratories, PBCs are composed of two charts: the `X-chart` and the `mR-chart`. Where the `X-chart` bounds the variation associated with individual values the `mR-chart` bounds the value-to-value variation. This is made possible through the calculation of a trio of limits known as process limits. The `upper process limit (UPL)` and `lower process limit (LPL)` are used on the `X-chart`. The `upper range limit (URL)` is used on the `mR-chart`. 
- **Two types of variation**: Inherent in the characterizations of `predictable` and `unpredictable` is the tyoe of variation action a process. A predictable process is influenced by only `routine` causes of variation. An `unpredictable` process is influenced by both `routine causes of variation` and `assignable` causes of variation.  
- **Improvement**: 
	- **Predictable**: To improve a predictable process `routine` causes of variation must be `identified`, `understood`, and `mitigated`.  This requires fundamental changes to the process must be made. These include, but are not limited to, changes to raw materials, adjustment to system settings, redesign of stations, redesign of software, calibration of measurement systems. 
	- **Unpredictable**: To improve an unpredictable process  `assignable` causes of variation must be `identifed`, `understood`, and `eliminated`. To begin this process, an investigation into values that fall outside the process limits on the `PBC` must be performed.
